# Weather-App
A weather app repository using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript would likely contain the following files:

index.html - This is the main HTML file that contains the markup for the weather app. It would include the necessary HTML tags such as <head>, <body>, <div>, and <form> to create the structure of the app.
style.css - This is the CSS file that contains the styles for the weather app. It would include the necessary CSS properties such as font-size, color, background-color, padding, and border-radius to style the app to the desired design.

script.js - This is the JavaScript file that contains the logic for the weather app. It would include code to fetch data from a weather API, parse the data, and update the UI with the relevant information. It would also include event listeners to handle user input, such as searching for a specific location or toggling between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
The HTML and CSS code for the weather app would typically be structured using a combination of flexbox and grid layout techniques to ensure that the app is responsive and displays correctly on all devices. The JavaScript code would use asynchronous programming techniques, such as Promises or async/await, to handle the API requests and responses.
Overall, the repository would provide a reusable and customizable weather app component that can be easily integrated into any website or web application.
